## Dataset for "Innovative Education: The Transformative Impact of Information and Communication Technologies"

### Overview
This repository contains the dataset used in the study titled *"Innovative Education: The Transformative Impact of Information and Communication Technologies"* by Mohammed Djelti and Hamza Kheddar. The dataset was collected to analyze the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in modern education, particularly during the shift to digital learning accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Dataset Description
The dataset comprises survey responses from **200 students** enrolled at the *National Higher School of Telecommunications and ICT, Oran, Algeria.* The study investigates various **pedagogical innovations** in digital education, including:

- **E-learning** (electronic learning)
- **M-learning** (mobile learning)
- **Blended learning** (combining online and face-to-face instruction)
- **Flipped classrooms** (self-paced learning before in-class activities)
- **Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)** policies
- **Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)**

### Data Collection
- **Methodology:** Mixed-method approach (quantitative survey analysis + qualitative insights)
- **Survey Format:** Structured questionnaire with **17 questions** (closed-ended multiple-choice and open-ended responses)
- **Participant Demographics:** Students from 2nd to 5th year, aged 18-26
- **Key Indicators:** Engagement levels, ICT resource accessibility, learning preferences, and infrastructure challenges

### Key Findings from the Dataset
- **78% of students** reported increased engagement with ICT-integrated learning models.
- **72% preferred blended learning** over traditional methods.
- **86% of students** relied on digital platforms such as Moodle, used by **90% of respondents**.
- **30% of students** struggled to access ICT resources.
- **78% cited unreliable internet connectivity** as a major barrier to digital learning.

### Data File Format
The dataset is stored in **CSV format** with the following columns:
- `ID`: Unique identifier for each respondent
- `Age`: Age of the student
- `Year`: Academic year (2nd to 5th)
- `Preferred_Learning_Method`: Chosen learning approach (e-learning, blended, flipped, etc.)
- `Engagement_Level`: Student-reported engagement percentage
- `ICT_Accessibility`: Availability of ICT resources (Yes/No)
- `Internet_Connectivity`: Rated reliability of internet (Good, Moderate, Poor)
- `Platform_Used`: Learning platform preference (Moodle, Google Classroom, YouTube, etc.)
- `Challenges_Faced`: Reported issues in digital learning

### How to Use the Dataset
1. **Exploratory Analysis:** Analyze learning preferences and challenges faced by students.
2. **Educational Policy Recommendations:** Use findings to improve ICT-based education strategies.
3. **Data Visualization:** Generate insights through engagement trend graphs.
4. **Machine Learning Applications:** Model student satisfaction and predict effective digital learning methods.
